  <b>Basics of WEB & HTML</b>
<br>
<em> - personal notes for Rohit Narang </em>
<br>
<br>
<em>Definitions</em>
<br>
WWW: World wide web
<br>
HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language
<br>
Hyperlinks: provides links between pages
<br>
<br>
<br>
<em>How it all ties in together?</em>
<br>
You (through your browser) access the internet which in turn uses the HTTP (protocol) to access the various servers
to access the information in the servers
<br>
<br>
HMTL is made up of
<br>- Text content
<br>- mark ups
<br>-references to (images, videos or other web pages)
<br>
<br>
<em>HTML Mark Up</em>
<br>
It comprises of opening tag & closing tag and the whole sequence is called element
<br>
B is used for <b>Bold</b><br>
Em is used for <em>italics</em>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<em>HTML Attributes</em>
<br>
"a" is used for Anchor which links the specific words to another webpage. For instance below
<br>
Really enjoy <a href="www.udacity.com"> good seesions! </a>
<br>
<br>
"img" is used for Images 
<br>
<br>
Important point: there are some tags which have no content so have no closing tags. These are also called <b> "VOID TAGS"</b>
<br>
<br>
<em>White Space</em>
<br>
All spaces in HTML are white spaces so unless specific commands are used, it will be presumed that everything is written in a flow.
<br>
<br>
"br" is line break
<br>
"p" is for one paragraph
<br>
The difference between the two is that while one is inline and otehr is a block. The block clubs all the words inside it as one cluster
<br>
<br>

<b><em>Highlights of this lesson:</b></em><br>
This has been extremely interesting to get the basics right and being able to play around with scratchpad.io or JSFiddle has been a lot of <b>FUN!</b>
